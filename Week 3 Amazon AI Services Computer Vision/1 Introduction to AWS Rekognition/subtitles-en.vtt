00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Hi. I'm Scott Gilbert

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.110
with AWS Training
and Certification.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.540
Welcome to Amazon Rekognition.

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.210
In this video, we will
discuss Rekognition,

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.685
part of Amazon's machine
learning offerings.

6
00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:14.370
I will highlight how easy
it is to get started with

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.870
Rekognition as well as give

8
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.150
an introduction to
its programmatic use.

9
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.000
I've been with AWS for just
under two years and I'm

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
currently responsible
for delivering

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.480
training across North America.

12
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.905
As part of the training team,

13
00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.410
I've contributed to
delivering classes as well

14
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.440
as assisting in the
creation of new content.

15
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.065
Rekognition is one of

16
00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.930
AWS's offerings in
artificial intelligence.

17
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.500
Rekognition allows you to
easily analyze images.

18
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.270
Your applications
can make calls to

19
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.970
Rekognition allowing
you to recognize faces,

20
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.105
landscapes, and even
the mood of a person.

21
00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:49.490
In this video, I will introduce

22
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.425
to you the service Rekognition.

23
00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:54.110
I will talk to you about the
benefits of the service as

24
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.140
well as go through the key
features of Rekognition.

25
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.080
I will step through a couple
of use cases of Rekognition,

26
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.065
highlighting just how
powerful the service can be.

27
00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:04.970
I will end this presentation with

28
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.875
a quick demonstration
of the service,

29
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.600
and I hope to have
you logging into

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.290
AWS to use this as well.

31
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.415
The main benefits of
Rekognition are it's

32
00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:16.845
ease of use as well
as its low cost.

33
00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:19.550
With zero experienced in
developing machine learning,

34
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.750
you can load an image into

35
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.690
Rekognition and it will be
analyzed automatically.

36
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.730
You can take
advantage of the APIs

37
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.190
we've created to
automate this analysis.

38
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.215
Best of all, as a
managed service,

39
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.910
Amazon will handle auto-scaling

40
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.590
of Rekognition allowing you to

41
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.480
potentially send
thousands of images

42
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.785
an hour for analysis
through recognition.

43
00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:39.465
The key features of Rekognition

44
00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:40.970
are object detection where

45
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.530
the engine is able to accurately

46
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.555
determine what isn't an image,

47
00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:46.715
facial analysis,
facial comparison,

48
00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:49.055
as well as facial recognition.

49
00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:51.500
The Engine is able
to determine mood,

50
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.835
the number of faces,

51
00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:54.380
as well as differentiating

52
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.215
different faces from each other.

53
00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:59.720
All processed images give
you a confidence score,

54
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.735
giving you the ability to
drop low confidence processes

55
00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:06.340
or perhaps flag them for
secondary or even manual review.

56
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.290
Let's look at a few use
cases for recognition.

57
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.690
Here, I hope to showcase
just how useful

58
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.675
and powerful the service can
be for your applications.

59
00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:17.150
Searchable image libraries
can be useful for

60
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.530
many cases such as

61
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.670
real estate agent looking to

62
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.335
take a picture of properties.

63
00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:24.485
They can then upload these
images to an S3 bucket.

64
00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:27.635
This upload automatically
triggers a lambda function.

65
00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:29.940
The Lambda function
calls Rekognition

66
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.260
which pulls the image
from the S3 bucket,

67
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.780
and analyze this image
and returns the image and

68
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.670
labels along with the
confidence scores for

69
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.890
each label into Elastic Search.

70
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.270
Users can now search

71
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.115
through the labels
to find the images.

72
00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:46.550
This makes searching for
keywords such as a garage or

73
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.525
yard far far easier for any
real estate application.

74
00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:53.245
Another use case would
be image moderation.

75
00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:56.210
This functionality can greatly
assist foreign moderators

76
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.255
ensuring that inappropriate
content is not posted.

77
00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:01.010
As a user uploads an image,

78
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.455
the object upload triggers
a lambda function.

79
00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:05.600
Lambda calls Rekognition which

80
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.625
examines the image
for the content.

81
00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:10.160
If there is no inappropriate
content found,

82
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.400
the picture is immediately
posted and viewable by users.

83
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.750
If there is inappropriate
content detected,

84
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360
the post is either rejected and

85
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.515
the image is removed
from storage.

86
00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:21.755
If the confidence scores
are not high enough,

87
00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:24.290
either way it can also
send the image for

88
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.865
manual review ensuring that

89
00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:27.680
only approved content is shown.

90
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.950
Sentiment analysis can be
quite useful for many users.

91
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.380
From retailers wanting to
track the effectiveness of

92
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.140
sales or demographic
information of the shoppers,

93
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.640
to a company that just wants to

94
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.725
ensure that their
workforce is happy.

95
00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:41.870
Live images are captured via

96
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.500
On-premise camera or
user uploaded image.

97
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.060
The application will send

98
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.625
the images to Rekognition
for our analysis.

99
00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.490
The app stores the
information in S3 and

100
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.965
Redshift will allow them
to receive this data in.

101
00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:57.740
Quick site can then be used for

102
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.824
regular analysis of
the information,

103
00:03:59.824 --> 00:04:01.685
tracking the sentiment over time.

104
00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:03.650
All information can
then be placed into

105
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.890
a weekly or monthly or even
quarterly marketing report

106
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.545
to track the effectiveness
of your ongoing sales,

107
00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:10.955
upgrades to the stores,

108
00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:13.825
or just changes in your
overall merchandise over time.

109
00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:15.060
I'm now going to step through

110
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.390
the Rekognition engine on AWS.

111
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.150
I hope to highlight just
how easy this is to use.

112
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.275
So I've logged into the
management console.

113
00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:27.080
Let's go ahead and load up
the Rekognition service.

114
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.270
If you've recently
visited the Engine,

115
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.355
you will see it here in your
recently visited Services.

116
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.910
Otherwise, you can click on

117
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.870
services and open up
the Rekognition Engine.

118
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.110
You can access Rekognition
programmatically and

119
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.435
use it's APIs to
analyze your images.

120
00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:47.210
You can download the SDK and run

121
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.060
your programs or write programs
that utilize Rekognition.

122
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.400
I'm just going to try the
demo to Rekognition to

123
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.070
highlight just how easy it
is to analyze your images.

124
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.870
As we pull up Rekognition,

125
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.260
we have some stock images

126
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.955
that are already
loaded into this.

127
00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:04.400
On the right, it will
show the results.

128
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.290
You have the labels as well as

129
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.465
the confidence score
for each label.

130
00:05:08.465 --> 00:05:10.314
There is, in fact, a skateboard,

131
00:05:10.314 --> 00:05:12.340
there's people in this image,

132
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.645
and there's cars parked
on the side of the road.

133
00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:16.805
We want to expand this
a little bit more.

134
00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:20.360
We see automobiles,
vehicle, intersection.

135
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.940
It is in fact on a
road all the way

136
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.530
down to it's in a metropolis,

137
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.030
there's SUVs and apartments.

138
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.575
This is a stock image.

139
00:05:29.575 --> 00:05:31.945
Let's go ahead and try
to upload our own.

140
00:05:31.945 --> 00:05:37.475
Click on the "Upload"
button and select an image.

141
00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:40.395
Now, this is an image of Seattle.

142
00:05:40.395 --> 00:05:43.605
Our labels found are
architecture, city,

143
00:05:43.605 --> 00:05:46.140
downtown, high rise, skyscraper,

144
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.545
as well as Metropolis.

145
00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:50.590
We have confidence scores
for all of these labels.

146
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.995
This is, in fact, a architecture
is shown in a city.

147
00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:56.710
It is downtown. There
are multiple high rises.

148
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.140
It is, in fact, in a Metropolis.

149
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.090
This image is fairly easy.

150
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.470
Let's look at another image.

151
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.515
This is multiple people in here.

152
00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:15.950
We have people, humans,
clothing, overcoat.

153
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.650
We want to go through
facial analysis.

154
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.465
In this image, we are detecting

155
00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:26.345
a face from the
rest of the image.

156
00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:29.970
We want to load in.

157
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.365
It is able to pull and
highlight where the faces are.

158
00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:39.990
Let's see if any of these
people are celebrities.

159
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.165
Well, I know this
person is a celebrity.

160
00:06:44.165 --> 00:06:46.600
Let's go back to our old image.

161
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.190
But unfortunately, none of

162
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.380
the people in this
image are celebrities.

163
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.775
So as you can see,

164
00:06:52.775 --> 00:06:55.025
Rekognition is quite easy to use.

165
00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:56.420
There are multiple tools

166
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.475
multiple demos that
are available.

167
00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:01.490
I really hope that you
log on and try to play

168
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.720
around with different images

169
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.450
and the analysis of the images.

170
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.300
In summary, Rekognition is

171
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.870
a great tool in our machine
learning offerings.

172
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.680
Rekognition gives
you the ability to

173
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.420
run multiple forms of analysis on

174
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.880
your images and
returns labels with

175
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.120
confidence scores to ensure
the analysis is accurate.

176
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.670
I hope you've learned a
little something and we'll

177
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.220
continue to explore
our other videos.

178
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.570
