00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.305
Hi. I'm Kirsten Dupart with

2
00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:15.345
AWS Training and Certification.

3
00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.205
Welcome to this
introductory course

4
00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:18.795
on Amazon Machine Learning.

5
00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:20.670
I've been with Amazon
for a year and a half,

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.050
and I'm currently responsible

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.490
for curriculum development within

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.640
the AWS Training and
Certification organization.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.080
I'll begin this course with

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.505
an overview of machine learning,

11
00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:32.100
and we'll talk about how data
plays an important role.

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.720
After the overview, we'll

13
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.310
discuss an innovative
way to build

14
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.295
smart applications and walk
through a few use cases,

15
00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:40.250
and then we'll wrap up
with a discussion of

16
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.065
the AWS frameworks and services

17
00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:45.210
you can use for machine
learning applications.

18
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.855
Machine learning is a subset
of artificial intelligence.

19
00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:52.670
It helps you use historical data

20
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.130
to make better
business decisions.

21
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.050
Machine learning is also

22
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.305
a process where
machines take data,

23
00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:01.259
analyze it to
generate predictions,

24
00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:04.145
and use those predictions
to make decisions.

25
00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:06.815
Those predictions
generate results,

26
00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:10.830
and those results are used to
improve future predictions.

27
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.735
Machine learning can make
predictions from huge datasets.

28
00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.770
It can also optimize utility
functions and extract

29
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.330
hidden patterns and
structures from

30
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.880
those datasets by
classifying data.

31
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.070
This enables a
software program to

32
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.680
learn and make predictions
in the future.

33
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.630
Machine learning enables you to

34
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.475
establish a cycle of improvement

35
00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:33.425
using the data you
collect from things like

36
00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.025
clickstreams,
purchases, and likes.

37
00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:38.240
Machine learning is
used in a number of

38
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.445
ways across a number
of industries.

39
00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:42.380
For example, it can be used

40
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.135
to detect fraudulent
transactions,

41
00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:47.810
filter spam emails, flag
suspicious reviews, and so on.

42
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.420
You begin by mining
large amounts of data to

43
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.165
identify patterns among
the card transactions.

44
00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:55.610
With these patterns, you can
train the machine learning

45
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.860
model to flag fraudulent
transactions.

46
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.460
It can also be used to
personalize content for users

47
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.190
by recommending content and
predictive content loading.

48
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.745
Machine learning can be used
for targeted marketing,

49
00:02:11.745 --> 00:02:13.995
matching customers with
offers they might like,

50
00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:15.880
choosing marketing campaigns, and

51
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.385
cross-selling or upselling items.

52
00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:20.650
Machine learning
can also be used to

53
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.854
automate categorisation
of documents

54
00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:24.580
such as matching
hiring managers and

55
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.405
resumes by learning to
understand written content.

56
00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:29.740
It can be used in customer
service to provide

57
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.570
predictive routing
of customer emails

58
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.385
based on the content
and the sender,

59
00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:36.800
as well as social media
listening capabilities.

60
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.340
Machine Learning systems discover

61
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.690
hidden patterns in data,

62
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.760
and use these patterns to
predict patterns in the future.

63
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.730
For example, if you're
analyzing retail data and

64
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.000
a product name contains
words like jeans or jacket,

65
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.555
then this product category
likely belongs to a parallel.

66
00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:56.330
Machine learning systems
learn from examples in

67
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.090
the same way that children
learn language or patterns.

68
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.220
It can group data into a summary,

69
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.810
and it can also define data in

70
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.685
a more granular concise way.

71
00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.170
Think of machine learning as

72
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.585
a combination of
methods and systems.

73
00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:10.640
These methods in systems

74
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.355
predict new data based
on observed data,

75
00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:16.280
extract hidden structure
from the data,

76
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.765
summarize data into
concise descriptions,

77
00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:22.040
optimize an action given

78
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.170
a cost function
and observed data,

79
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.540
and adapt based on observed data.

80
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.700
The field of machine learning
is often classified into

81
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.890
the following broad categories:
supervised learning,

82
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.710
unsupervised learning, and
reinforcement learning.

83
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.280
In supervised learning,
the inputs to the model

84
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.055
including the example outputs
also known as labels,

85
00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.990
are known and the model learns to

86
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.705
generalize the outputs
from these examples.

87
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:50.885
In unsupervised learning,
the labels aren't known.

88
00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:52.430
The model finds patterns in

89
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.375
structure from the
data without any help.

90
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:57.560
In reinforcement learning,

91
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.110
the model learns by
interacting with

92
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.790
its environment
and learns to take

93
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.265
action to maximize
the total reward.

94
00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:05.530
In supervised learning,
the inputs to

95
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.080
the model in the example
outputs are provided,

96
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.580
and the model learns
to generalize

97
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.755
the outputs from these examples.

98
00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:14.440
The human teachers
experience is used to tell

99
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.365
the model which outputs are
correct and which are not.

100
00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:18.880
This doesn't mean
that the teacher

101
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.380
has to be physically present,

102
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.830
only that the teachers'
classifications must be present.

103
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.695
With the help of a
large training dataset,

104
00:04:26.695 --> 00:04:28.570
the model learns
from its error and

105
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.680
changes its weight to reduce
its prediction error.

106
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.515
In classification,

107
00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:36.280
the output variable is
a category like color,

108
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.395
which could be red,
blue, or green,

109
00:04:38.395 --> 00:04:39.620
and it results in true or

110
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.130
false for a particular question.

111
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.380
In regression, the output
variable is a number

112
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.875
or a value like weight,
dollars, or temperature.

113
00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:51.800
In unsupervised learning
which is also called

114
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.080
self-organization,
there's no teacher.

115
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.800
It's based solely on
local information.

116
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.360
Here, the model
uses only the data

117
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.670
presented to the network
without any labels,

118
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.380
and it detects the
emerging properties

119
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.195
of the whole dataset.

120
00:05:05.195 --> 00:05:07.610
The model then
constructs patterns from

121
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.330
the available information
without any pre-trained data.

122
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.690
In clustering, the model
discovers groupings in

123
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.830
the data like grouping

124
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.530
customers based on their
purchasing behavior.

125
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.140
In association, the
model discovers

126
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.180
rules that govern
large chunks of data,

127
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.805
for example customers
who buy product A,

128
00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:27.890
also tend to buy product B.

129
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.130
In reinforcement learning,
a software agent determines

130
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.360
the ideal behavior within

131
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.375
a specific context for
a particular problem.

132
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:37.550
The agent takes the input and

133
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.920
decides the best action
for the problem,

134
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.225
and then based on the
results of the action,

135
00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:43.300
the agent than receives

136
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.770
simple reward feedback to

137
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.540
allow it to learn
from its behavior.

138
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.790
The agent is encouraged
to select an action

139
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.460
that maximizes the
reward in the long-term.

140
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.740
This type of machine
learning algorithm is

141
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.230
inspired by behavioral
psychology.

142
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.510
Part of getting useful
information out of

143
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.770
your Machine Learning system

144
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.805
is having a smart application.

145
00:06:01.805 --> 00:06:04.540
Your smart application will
use machine learning to

146
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.820
analyze your data and
predict future outcomes,

147
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.565
which are necessary to
make business decisions.

148
00:06:09.565 --> 00:06:11.890
This can include using
machine learning

149
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.690
for business questions
such as predicting

150
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.100
customer trends like whether

151
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.220
customers will use a
particular product of yours,

152
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.780
or to determine if an
order is fraudulent.

153
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.515
Based on the customer
data you already have,

154
00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.920
you can find patterns in
the data and then generate

155
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.240
predictions to drive your product

156
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.530
features and improvements.

157
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.760
While machine learning is
a rapidly growing field

158
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.180
with an enormous upside
for companies to use,

159
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.560
there are some challenges
to take into consideration

160
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.850
when building your
machine learning

161
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.410
based smart application.

162
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.230
For instance, some machine
learning technology can

163
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.900
be complex to use and
implement appropriately,

164
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.980
requiring high levels of

165
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.800
expertise that can take
time to hire or develop.

166
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.510
Another challenge is finding

167
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.680
the right technology that

168
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.840
scales to the needs of customers.

169
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.850
Finally, being able to tie

170
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.820
machine learning to a business
application can take time.

171
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.410
In other words, refining

172
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.820
your models so that
your product app

173
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.870
can use that model

174
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.240
productively can
require a lot of time.

175
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.770
These are the three primary

176
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.970
considerations you should take

177
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.020
into account when building

178
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.895
your machine learning
application.

179
00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:13.250
One way to help address
these challenges

180
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.740
could be to use Amazon
Machine Learning.

181
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.530
We have offerings in Amazon
Machine Learning and

182
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.110
Spark on Amazon
Elastic MapReduce or

183
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.840
Amazon EMR for customers
who want to fully

184
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.080
manage platform for building
models using their own data.

185
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.490
For developers and data

186
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.875
scientists who want to
focus on building models,

187
00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:32.150
the platform services

188
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.085
remove the
undifferentiated overhead

189
00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:35.570
associated with deploying and

190
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.165
managing infrastructure
for training and hosting.

191
00:07:38.165 --> 00:07:40.100
Amazon Machine Learning support

192
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.410
supervised machine
learning approaches.

193
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.940
These enable you to predict

194
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.455
specific machine learning tasks

195
00:07:45.455 --> 00:07:47.270
such as binary classification,

196
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.180
multiclass classification,
and regression.

197
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.490
Binary classification
predicts the answer

198
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.915
to a yes or no question.

199
00:07:53.915 --> 00:07:57.335
For example, is this
email spam or not spam?

200
00:07:57.335 --> 00:07:59.750
Is this product a book or a toy,

201
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.730
or is this review written
by a customer or a robot?

202
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.645
Multiclass classification

203
00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:07.790
predicts the correct
category from a list.

204
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.435
For example, is this product
a movie or clothing?

205
00:08:11.435 --> 00:08:14.345
Is this movie a romantic,
comedy, documentary,

206
00:08:14.345 --> 00:08:17.270
or thriller, or which category

207
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.985
of products is most
interesting to this customer?

208
00:08:19.985 --> 00:08:23.255
Regression predicts the
value of a numeric variable.

209
00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:24.950
For example, what will

210
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.795
the temperature be
in Seattle tomorrow?

211
00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:28.565
Or for this product,

212
00:08:28.565 --> 00:08:30.385
how many units will sell?

213
00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.630
Lastly, how many days before

214
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.135
the customer stops
using the application?

215
00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:37.850
At a broad level, these
are the steps involved in

216
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.065
building a smart application

217
00:08:39.065 --> 00:08:40.880
using Amazon Machine Learning.

218
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.890
To train a model,
you need to create

219
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.990
a data source object
pointing to your data,

220
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.220
explore and understand your data,

221
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.485
and transform data
and train your model.

222
00:08:49.485 --> 00:08:52.175
To then evaluate and
optimize the model,

223
00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:54.484
you need to understand
model quality

224
00:08:54.484 --> 00:08:56.920
and adjust model interpretation.

225
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.180
After that, you can retrieve

226
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.010
batch and real-time predictions.

227
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.190
Let's take a quick look at

228
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.680
a case study for using
Amazon Machine Learning.

229
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.390
Zillow is a company that provides

230
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.360
home valuations online
in the United States.

231
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.980
When the company
needed to provide

232
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.260
more timely home
valuations for customers,

233
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.780
they decided to run their
home valuation tool using

234
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.210
Amazon Kinesis for
data ingestion,

235
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.350
and Apache Spark on

236
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.730
Amazon EMR for data
processing and analysis.

237
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.170
Now, Zillow runs its
machine learning

238
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.110
tasks in hours instead of days,

239
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.135
and it provides more
accurate valuation data too.

240
00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:34.130
I hope you learned a
little something and we'll

241
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.505
continue to explore
our other courses.

242
00:09:36.505 --> 00:09:38.235
Again, I'm Kirsten Dupart with

243
00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:41.950
AWS Training and Certification,
thanks for watching.
