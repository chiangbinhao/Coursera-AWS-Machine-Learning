00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.270
Hello my name's
Vikram Madan and I'm

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.770
a senior product manager here at

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.810
AWS on the deep learning team.

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.370
Today, I want to tell you about

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.725
Amazon Sage Maker Ground Truth.

6
00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:16.500
Ground Truth is a
new capability of

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
Amazon Sage Maker that
makes it easy for you to

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.785
efficiently and accurately label

9
00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:24.810
the datasets that are required

10
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.015
for training machine
learning systems.

11
00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:30.000
Ground Truth can automatically
labels some part of

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.980
the training dataset
and then sends

13
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.305
the rest to human
workers for labeling.

14
00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:37.830
Ground Truth also uses
innovative algorithms and

15
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.290
user experience
techniques to improve

16
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500
the accuracy of the labeling

17
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.240
that's sent to human workers.

18
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.905
So the current
method for building

19
00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:52.160
a training dataset involves
a lot of manual effort,

20
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.855
and is prone to errors.

21
00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:55.970
It often involves distributing

22
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.795
labeling tasks across a large
number of human workers.

23
00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:02.495
This can add
significant overhead,

24
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:07.420
and cost, and leave room
for human error and bias.

25
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.830
Additionally, an
operation like this is

26
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.440
extremely complex to manage,

27
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.645
and can take months to process.

28
00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:17.815
So how does Ground Truth
actually fix this problem?

29
00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:20.930
It makes it easy to
efficiently perform

30
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.910
highly accurate
data labeling using

31
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.960
your data stored in Amazon S3.

32
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.010
Ground Truth provides a managed

33
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.675
experience where you can set up

34
00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:33.590
an end-to-end labeling job
with just a few clicks.

35
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.945
You simply need to provide a
pointer to your data in S3,

36
00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:39.950
Ground Truth then offers a set of

37
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.710
templates for common
labeling tasks,

38
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.835
where you only need to click

39
00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:45.890
a few choices and then provide

40
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.050
some minimal instructions to

41
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.710
the human workers to
get your data labeled.

42
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.475
Then you select one of the
three workforce options,

43
00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:59.360
and then on completion
of a labeling job,

44
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.560
Ground Truth will send

45
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.295
the outputted labeled
data to your S3 bucket.

46
00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:08.370
So when selecting a workforce
to perform labeling,

47
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.165
you have three choices.

48
00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.535
You can send a labeling task to

49
00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:16.865
the Public Mechanical Turk
Crowdsource Workforce,

50
00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:20.840
you can use one of this
pre-approved third-party vendors

51
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.600
that are listed on
the AWS marketplace,

52
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.300
and you can even bring
your own internal workers,

53
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.664
and what that actually
means is that we host

54
00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:33.060
a labeling application on

55
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.495
which you can onboard
these workers.

56
00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:38.245
So now, let's talk about how

57
00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:40.250
ground-truth helps you improve

58
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.410
the accuracy of
your data labeling.

59
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.870
There's two core aspects here.

60
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.040
The first are innovative UX
techniques that are directly

61
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.150
built into these templates that

62
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.155
you can use for common
labeling tasks.

63
00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:57.170
In addition, Ground
Truth provides

64
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.005
a set of built-in
algorithms that help

65
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:04.895
improve the accuracy
of labeling by taking

66
00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.130
in the inputs of

67
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.170
workers and outputting
high fidelity label.

68
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.470
Next, let's talk about how

69
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.305
Ground Truth improves the
efficiency of data labeling.

70
00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:20.240
Ground Truth has

71
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.164
innovative feature called
Automatic Labeling,

72
00:03:23.164 --> 00:03:25.355
which actually
automatically labels

73
00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:27.395
a subset of your dataset.

74
00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:29.210
A portion of your dataset will

75
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.685
still be labeled by humans.

76
00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:34.535
But next, let's
double-click on how

77
00:03:34.535 --> 00:03:38.075
Automatic Labeling
actually works.

78
00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:41.990
It uses an innovative
ML technique

79
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.400
called Active Learning,

80
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.760
that helps us understand
which data is

81
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.620
well understood and can

82
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.865
be potentially
automatically labeled,

83
00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:53.444
and then which data is
not well understood,

84
00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:56.600
and may need to be looked
at humans for labeling.

85
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.060
What happens is that Ground
Truth can actually look at

86
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.165
your training dataset and

87
00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:07.860
identify which data is not
well understood and thus,

88
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.875
needs to be sent to humans.

89
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.590
It also can identify
which data is

90
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.385
very well understood and can
be automatically labeled.

91
00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:20.805
Now, how all the magic works
is that under the hood,

92
00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:22.740
Ground Truth is actually training

93
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.035
an ML model in your
SageMaker account.

94
00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:28.500
This whole process is iterative,

95
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.710
and Ground Truth breaks
up your data into

96
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.155
batches and repeats this cycle

97
00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:35.440
until all your data is labeled.

98
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.030
Okay. So now, let's
take a step back and

99
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.850
understand what all of
this means for you.

100
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.440
First and foremost,

101
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.050
Ground Truth makes
data labeling easy.

102
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.690
It also helps you lower
your total cost of

103
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.895
data labeling by
up to 70 percent.

104
00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:52.580
Ground Truth enables you to

105
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.770
securely manage your datasets,

106
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.930
and it can help you increase

107
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.525
the accuracy of
your labeled data.

108
00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:01.940
Now, let's take a look
at Ground Truth in

109
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.675
action to get a better
feel for these features.

110
00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:08.720
So now, I'm going
to walk through on

111
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.405
how to create a
data labeling job,

112
00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:14.240
and it's just a few
clicks and a handful of

113
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.770
informational fields and we can

114
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.435
essentially kickoff
a data labeling job.

115
00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:21.710
Now, there's three aspects
to data labeling job.

116
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.515
First of all, you need to
provide us the input dataset.

117
00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:26.150
Then you need to tell
us when it needs to be

118
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.490
performed on that datasets.

119
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.725
So the actual labeling task,

120
00:05:30.725 --> 00:05:34.100
and then finally, you need
to configure a workforce.

121
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.960
So I'll walk through each of

122
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.360
those three pieces and this
is all in the context of me

123
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.070
having 10 pictures and
I want to be able to

124
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.235
identify if my family dog

125
00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:53.365
whose name is Freckles
is in those pictures.

126
00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:57.420
Now, we'll walk through
the first part,

127
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.209
the input dataset first,

128
00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:00.905
and here you see we've actually

129
00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:02.930
already prepped that here.

130
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.960
So you provide us
an input manifest,

131
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.940
which is a JSON document and you

132
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.430
can see a Freckles manifest here.

133
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.680
You also provide us where we

134
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.760
will output the labeled data,

135
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.040
and this is the same
bucket as here.

136
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.725
So let's quickly take a look at

137
00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:24.440
what that manifest looks like.

138
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.915
So here we have

139
00:06:26.915 --> 00:06:29.150
the input manifest and this is

140
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.430
a simple JSON lines document.

141
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.965
So you can see each
of the images,

142
00:06:33.965 --> 00:06:35.825
it's its own line,

143
00:06:35.825 --> 00:06:40.970
and you provide the S3
URL for that image.

144
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.280
So that's how the input manifests

145
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.425
looks and I'm going
to minimize this now,

146
00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:48.800
and that we're just
providing a pointer

147
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.195
to here and in it's S3.

148
00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:55.805
So now, we also you have to
give access to the service,

149
00:06:55.805 --> 00:06:58.340
to these S3 locations.

150
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.330
That's as simple as creating
a role for those S3 buckets.

151
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.400
So here I've already
provisioned a role,

152
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.975
that if I had to
create a new one,

153
00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:07.985
I could just go to
the create role,

154
00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:09.560
and provide the names of

155
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.530
the S3 buckets that I
want to give access to.

156
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.765
I'm not going to
create that here.

157
00:07:14.765 --> 00:07:18.150
But I'm going to move on
to the next step now.

158
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.190
So now, we finished
the first aspect

159
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.660
of the data labeling job which

160
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.440
is providing the input dataset,

161
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.150
and we're going to select
the actual task type.

162
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.135
So this is what's going to
be performed on the task,

163
00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:34.115
on the input dataset,

164
00:07:34.115 --> 00:07:35.660
and if you remember,

165
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.270
I'm actually trying
to identify whether

166
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.880
my family dog named Freckles

167
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.240
is actually in one of the
images that I provided.

168
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.150
So I'm actually going to do
an image classification task

169
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.200
and this is pretty simple.

170
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.530
Basically, I want to
show an image and ask,

171
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.255
is Freckles in this image?

172
00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:56.190
Or as Freckles not in this image?

173
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.520
We're going to move to next

174
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.670
and we're going to move
from that second step,

175
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.470
which is the labeling task to

176
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.525
actually configuring
the workforce,

177
00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:10.504
and here, you see I've already

178
00:08:10.504 --> 00:08:13.955
decided to use the Public
Mechanical Turk Work Force.

179
00:08:13.955 --> 00:08:15.590
I have to ensure that there's

180
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.730
no adult content in my images.

181
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.130
I also need to make sure
that I'm not sending

182
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.190
any sensitive data to
the public workforce,

183
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.440
because these will be
publicly accessible and

184
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.850
shown to a globally
distributed public workforce.

185
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.135
So I've clicked those two aspects

186
00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:39.030
and I've configured
the public workforce.

187
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:46.310
Now, I'm going to return
to the task setup and I'm

188
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.780
actually going to configure

189
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.925
the actual task that the
labeling workforce will see.

190
00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:59.165
Here is essentially
the task prompt.

191
00:08:59.165 --> 00:09:00.485
These are the options.

192
00:09:00.485 --> 00:09:02.930
This is Freckles,
this is not Freckles,

193
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.990
and then we have actually

194
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.030
the informational
panel that will be

195
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.780
shown to the labelers So
here's a good example.

196
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.650
Freckles is a black cocker
spaniel, with white spots,

197
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.165
she's 17 years old and she
has red heart-shaped tag.

198
00:09:17.165 --> 00:09:19.205
This is a bad example.

199
00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:22.270
Please make sure that dogs
that are not Freckles,

200
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.000
please label them as
this is not Freckles.

201
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.020
So let's actually take a look at

202
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.880
what the labeler will see.

203
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.440
So this is actually what
the label or will see,

204
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.720
the image that we will have in

205
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.195
the dataset will
be rendered here,

206
00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:48.300
and then, if I select that
this is Freckles, basically,

207
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.700
I can submit this and voila,

208
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.970
you have a task completed.

209
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.450
But this is just a preview,

210
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.635
we'll go back to the workflow,

211
00:09:56.635 --> 00:10:00.095
and now we're ready to
kick off this workflow.

212
00:10:00.095 --> 00:10:02.330
I did want to show one more thing

213
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.870
in terms of the automatic
labeling feature.

214
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.200
It's as simple as
clicking a check box,

215
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.735
and with that checkbox,

216
00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:13.385
you essentially have
enabled automatic labeling.

217
00:10:13.385 --> 00:10:16.730
Ground Truth will then
essentially easily be

218
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.425
able to automatically
label the data.

219
00:10:20.425 --> 00:10:22.305
So now that we're ready,

220
00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:25.835
we can submit this and
it will be sent out to

221
00:10:25.835 --> 00:10:27.050
the public Mechanical Turk

222
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.850
Workforce, and then, basically,

223
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.800
once the data labeling
job is completed,

224
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.550
it will take the
outputted labels,

225
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.065
augment that initial
manifest that you provided,

226
00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:41.615
and drop that into
your S3 bucket,

227
00:10:41.615 --> 00:10:43.879
and we can take a look at quickly

228
00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:47.000
how that augmented
manifests looks like.

229
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.490
So here, if you remember,

230
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.040
we have all the images that
we had in that manifest,

231
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.500
and we have the
associated label with

232
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.210
that and associated
metadata with that label.

233
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.280
You have a confidence score.

234
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.440
You also have what

235
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.175
the actual label
category will look like.

236
00:11:10.175 --> 00:11:12.405
As well as other
information are like,

237
00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:16.295
whether it was human
annotated or auto annotated.

238
00:11:16.295 --> 00:11:19.300
Thank you for learning
about Ground Truth today.

239
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.910
My name's Vikram Madan,

240
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.990
and thanks for watching.
