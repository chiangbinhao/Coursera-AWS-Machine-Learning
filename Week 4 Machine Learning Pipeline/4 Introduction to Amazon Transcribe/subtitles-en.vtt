00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi. I'm Patty Raymond for

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.040
Amazon Web Services,
Training and Certification.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.330
For the next few minutes,

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.220
I'm going to walk you
through a quick overview

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.035
of Amazon Transcribe.

6
00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:11.970
Amazon Transcribe is

7
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.205
an automatic speech
recognition service

8
00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.049
also known as ASR,

9
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.265
that's designed to make it

10
00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:19.140
easy for developers
to incorporate

11
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.290
speech-to-text capabilities
into their applications.

12
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.910
In this course, I'll highlight

13
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.814
the features of
Amazon Transcribe,

14
00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:27.480
talk a bit about how it works,

15
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.210
and provide a few examples
of common use cases.

16
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.620
I'll also tell you how to get

17
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.230
started and give a
quick demonstration.

18
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.380
Historically, people
saved most data in

19
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.220
structured formats that were
relatively easy to search.

20
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.990
For example, information entered

21
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.910
into databases via forms or

22
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.950
saved and spreadsheets
is pretty easy

23
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.595
to analyze even at
very high volumes.

24
00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:51.100
Increasingly, we capture data in

25
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.700
less structured
formats that are more

26
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.935
difficult to analyze
on a large scale.

27
00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:58.790
In particular, the speech in
audio and video files needs

28
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.290
to be recorded as text

29
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.220
before it can be
searched or categorized.

30
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.360
Traditionally,
converting audio content

31
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.065
to text has required a lot
of human intervention.

32
00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:11.930
Someone has to play back the
recording and capture all of

33
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.000
the speaker's words
in text form and then

34
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.235
review and edit the
transcribed content.

35
00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:19.130
Even with the benefit of
a speech-to-text tool,

36
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.055
a lot of editing and
formatting is required.

37
00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:25.250
This is particularly true
for outputs that require

38
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.870
high levels of accuracy and

39
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.320
readability like video subtitles.

40
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.640
The high level of
effort to manually

41
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.980
convert these media to
text means that only

42
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.350
the most critical items
are transcribed and

43
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.355
valuable information
may be overlooked.

44
00:01:39.355 --> 00:01:41.570
Amazon Transcribe can help

45
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.505
you address these
potential barriers.

46
00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:45.380
Amazon Transcribe is

47
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.905
a fully managed and continually
trained ASR service

48
00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:52.175
that accepts common audio
formats including WAV,

49
00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:55.160
MP3, MP4, and FLAC,

50
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.870
and can accurately transcribe

51
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.845
both low fidelity and
high fidelity audio.

52
00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:01.880
This makes it a natural fit for

53
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.145
use cases such as
transcribing customer

54
00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:07.070
service calls into
analyzable data or

55
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.200
generating subtitles for videos

56
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.425
with a high level of accuracy.

57
00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:14.420
Amazon Transcribe
uses deep learning to

58
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.195
provide accurate and
quick transcriptions.

59
00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:19.910
It was designed to make
it easy for you to get

60
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.500
even greater accuracy and

61
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.155
usefulness from the
transcribed output.

62
00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:26.990
For example, the output is

63
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.170
not just one long
uninterrupted string of text.

64
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.710
Instead, Amazon
Transcribe uses machine

65
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.910
learning to add in

66
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.520
punctuation and
grammatical formatting.

67
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.170
So the texts you get back
is immediately usable.

68
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.100
Amazon Transcribe also
timestamps every word,

69
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.730
which makes it easy to align

70
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.650
subtitles for close captioning.

71
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.750
It also makes it easy to index.

72
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.075
Transcripts include
confidence levels

73
00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:55.280
for each word of the
transcribed output,

74
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.140
making it easy to determine where

75
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.710
more editing or quality
assurance may be required.

76
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.500
Amazon Transcribe also
helps you mitigate

77
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.185
issues with source audio
to improve accuracy.

78
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.910
For example, you can upload

79
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.370
custom vocabulary
that can help improve

80
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.100
the accuracy if the content
you're transcribing has

81
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.520
industry-specific terms like
medical or legal terms.

82
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.785
You can choose the language
of the source file.

83
00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:20.695
The supported
languages are listed,

84
00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:23.990
and Amazon Transcribe
attribute speech to

85
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.580
different speakers to make it

86
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.935
easier to interpret the output.

87
00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:30.290
Because Amazon Transcribe was

88
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.590
designed to be easy
for developers to use,

89
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.240
there are only a few
steps to get started.

90
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.820
You don't need to understand
how the underlying models

91
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.170
work and you don't need to

92
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.135
build your own machine
learning models.

93
00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:42.785
You invoke the service via

94
00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:45.260
API and with a few lines of code,

95
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.740
you're ready to transcribe
files on Amazon S3.

96
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.490
You can easily initiate the
transcription operation via

97
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.740
the AWS management console

98
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.745
and you can test the service
via the console too.

99
00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:01.295
Amazon Transcribe offers
secure communication

100
00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:02.510
between the service and

101
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.435
your applications
through SSL encryption.

102
00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:09.365
You can access your
transcriptions via assigned URLs.

103
00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:11.735
You can also make sure
that information is

104
00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:13.850
kept secure and confidential by

105
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.414
controlling access
to Amazon Transcribe

106
00:04:16.414 --> 00:04:19.400
through AWS IAM policies.

107
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.830
The service integrates
easily with

108
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.705
other AWS services such
as Amazon Comprehend,

109
00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:30.905
Amazon ES, Amazon Translate,
and Amazon Athena.

110
00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:32.885
You can easily leverage

111
00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:35.270
powerful deep learning
models combined with

112
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.540
highly scalable index
searching and analysis tools

113
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.500
to reap high-value from your
audio and video content.

114
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.860
Here are a few examples.

115
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.920
A call center uses Amazon
Transcribe to produce

116
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.410
transcriptions of
low-fidelity phone calls

117
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.150
with high accuracy.

118
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.640
The center uses Amazon Comprehend

119
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.350
on the transcribed data to

120
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.940
identify key phrases and

121
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.195
customer sentiments so that
they can classify the calls.

122
00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:05.285
They use Amazon Athena
to query the data and

123
00:05:05.285 --> 00:05:07.490
Amazon QuickSight to visualize

124
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.255
the results and analyze trends.

125
00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:13.620
The Human Resources
Department uses

126
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.650
Amazon Transcribe to generate

127
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.260
transcriptions of meetings
and training sessions,

128
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.395
then indexes the results
using Amazon ES.

129
00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:23.780
Internal stakeholders
can quickly search for

130
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.335
content on demand to
locate topics of interest.

131
00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:30.170
A video production business uses

132
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.060
Amazon Transcribe to produce

133
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.120
transcriptions of audio
tracks for subtitles.

134
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.480
Limited editing is done
on the output files and

135
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.340
the quality assurance
team can focus

136
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.905
on sections that have
lower confidence ratings.

137
00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:45.730
Using the timestamps in
the transcript file,

138
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.325
they can easily align the
captions with the video.

139
00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:51.560
They use Amazon
Translate to convert

140
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.365
the transcript into
additional languages.

141
00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:57.245
You can even translate
conversations.

142
00:05:57.245 --> 00:05:59.540
Use Amazon Transcribe to

143
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.440
generate the transcription
of the speaker's message.

144
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.820
Use Amazon Comprehend to

145
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.770
recognize the language
of the speaker,

146
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.290
and use Amazon
Translate to translate

147
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.885
the message into the
receiver's language.

148
00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:14.420
Then, use Amazon Polly to

149
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.195
read the translated
message to the recipient.

150
00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:19.065
To get started, you'll need to

151
00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:21.050
save the file you
want to transcribe on

152
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.100
Amazon S3 stored in a bucket
with the proper permissions.

153
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.300
The files must be in one of
four formats; FLAC, MP3,

154
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.650
MP4, or WAV, and they must
be less than two hours long.

155
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.810
For best results, source files

156
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.640
should use lossless compression,

157
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.755
FLAC or WAV, and recording

158
00:06:39.755 --> 00:06:42.110
should be done in a
low-noise environment.

159
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.360
You'll want to limit
crosstalk too.

160
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.730
You'll need an AWS account with

161
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.335
an IAM user who has

162
00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:51.410
full access to the
transcribed API calls,

163
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.245
and you should be
familiar with the CLI.

164
00:06:54.245 --> 00:06:56.840
You'll also need a text editor.

165
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.360
We also recommend that you

166
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.160
review the developer's
guide which you can

167
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.500
find in the AWS documentation
under Amazon Transcribe.

168
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.670
For the demonstration, I'll use

169
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.895
the AWS management
console to start a job,

170
00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:12.830
verify that it's completed,

171
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.630
and then review the results.

172
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.225
On the AWS management console,

173
00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:19.720
select "Amazon Transcribe."

174
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.205
Then click the "Try
Amazon Transcribe" button

175
00:07:23.205 --> 00:07:26.415
to open the "Create
Transcription Job" dialogue.

176
00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:28.575
Give your job a relevant name.

177
00:07:28.575 --> 00:07:30.500
For this demonstration,
I'm going to

178
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.780
use Gettysburg Address test.

179
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.585
Paste or type the location
of the source file

180
00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:38.665
on Amazon S3 that you
want to transcribe.

181
00:07:38.665 --> 00:07:40.470
Select the source language.

182
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.520
For this demonstration,
I'll use English,

183
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.855
and select the format
of your source file.

184
00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:47.180
For this example, it's MP3.

185
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.855
Optionally, I can specify
the media sampling rate.

186
00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:52.640
This rate must match

187
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.505
the sampling rate of the
associated media content.

188
00:07:55.505 --> 00:07:57.890
Sampling rates between
8000 hertz and

189
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.660
48,000 hertz are supported
by Amazon Transcribe.

190
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.390
Once I fill that in,

191
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.820
I click the "Create" button and

192
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.385
my job has been submitted
for processing.

193
00:08:07.385 --> 00:08:09.860
Once the request
has been submitted,

194
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.020
I can check the
status of the job by

195
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.580
selecting "Transcription Jobs"
from the menu on the left.

196
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.900
This opens a list
of available jobs.

197
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.865
You may see older transcripts.

198
00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:21.410
That's because the service makes

199
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.955
transcription results
available for 90 days.

200
00:08:24.955 --> 00:08:26.785
In the status column,

201
00:08:26.785 --> 00:08:28.640
I can see that my
job is in progress.

202
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.905
If I click on the
job name itself,

203
00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:33.980
I can review the details
of the job and also review

204
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.775
or copy the sample JSON
request for this job.

205
00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:40.580
When the status of
the job is completed,

206
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.340
I'll be able to select
the output URL from

207
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.060
the job details page and
review the transcribed text.

208
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.950
The output file is placed in

209
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.210
an S3 bucket and is only
accessible with assigned URI.

210
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.690
For added security,
the URI is valid for

211
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.190
only a few minutes after you

212
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.070
initially request
the job results.

213
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.475
Just taking a quick
look at the transcript,

214
00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:05.240
I can see that the content
of my MP3 file has been

215
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.250
transcribed with formatting
and punctuation,

216
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.370
and I can see the timestamps and

217
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.560
confidence levels for
each word in the file.

218
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.390
In summary, Amazon Transcribe is

219
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.130
a fully managed and continually

220
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.050
trained ASR service that is

221
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.975
designed to make it easy for
developers to incorporate

222
00:09:23.975 --> 00:09:26.075
accurate speech-to-text
capabilities

223
00:09:26.075 --> 00:09:27.815
into their applications.

224
00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:29.570
I hope you found
this introduction

225
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.445
to Amazon Transcribe helpful,

226
00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:33.350
and that you're ready
to try it yourself.
